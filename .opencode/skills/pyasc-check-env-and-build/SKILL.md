# PyAsc Build

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- A user asks to build or install the PyAsc project
- A developer needs to set up the build environment from scratch
- Environment variables need to be configured for compilation
- The user wants to verify that all build prerequisites are met
- A new contributor needs guidance through the full setup and build process

## Agent Pipeline

### Phase 1: Check LLVM Installation

**Goal**: Verify that a pre-built LLVM repository exists and `LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX` is set.

**Steps**:

1. **Check if `LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX` environment variable is set**
   ```bash
   echo $LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX
   ```

2. **If not set, search standard locations**
   - Check parent directory (most common): `ls -d ../llvm-*`
   - Check other locations: `/usr/local/llvm-*`, `~/llvm-*`, `$HOME/.local/llvm-*`
   - Ask user to provide the full path to LLVM installation
   - If found: Suggest setting `LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX` and add `export LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` to the current build session

3. **Verify LLVM libraries and CMake configs exist** (compilers are installed system-wide via `apt install build-essential ccache clang lld`)
   ```bash
   ls -la $LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/cmake/mlir/MLIRConfig.cmake
   ls -la $LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/cmake/llvm/LLVMConfig.cmake
   ls -d $LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX/include/mlir
   ls -d $LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX/include/llvm
   ls -la $LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin/mlir-tblgen
   ls -la $LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin/FileCheck*
   ```

4. **Check versions**
   ```bash
   $LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin/llvm-config --version
   ```

**If LLVM not found**:

Report the error to the user. Download links can be found in @docs/installation/build-from-source.rst.

Ask the user where to download LLVM (suggest home directory `~/llvm` as default location).

**Failure handling**:
- LLVM not found: Provide download links above
- Missing CMake configs or headers: "LLVM installation appears incomplete. Missing: {path}"
- Permission errors: Suggest `chmod +x $LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin/*`

---

### Phase 2: Determine Build Context

**Goal**: Determine if the user is a developer (likely needs Debug mode) or just building for usage (Release mode). This affects which environment variables are set.

**Step 1 (MANDATORY)**: Ask the user which build configuration they need.

Ask exactly this question:
"Which build configuration do you need?
- **Developer build** (Debug): Includes devtools (ascir-opt, ascir-lsp, ascir-translate), ccache, clang/lld. Recommended for contributing to pyasc.
- **Standard build** (Release): Minimal build for running kernels. Debug tools (ascir-opt, ascir-lsp, ascir-translate) will not be available."

**DO NOT** proceed to Step 2 until you receive an answer. **DO NOT** infer the answer from context clues (source code presence, .venv, AGENTS.md, etc.).

**Step 2**: Based on user's answer, set environment variables:

- If user chooses Developer build: **Developer context** (Debug build)
- If user chooses Standard build: **User context** (Release build)
- If user's response is still ambiguous: Ask for clarification

**Developer context** environment variables:

```bash
export LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/llvm          # required
export PYASC_SETUP_CONFIG=Debug                    # Debug for development
export PYASC_SETUP_DEVTOOLS=1                      # build ascir-opt, ascir-lsp, ascir-translate
export PYASC_SETUP_CCACHE=1                        # faster rebuilds
export PYASC_SETUP_CLANG_LLD=1                     # use clang/lld
export PYASC_SETUP_JOBS=$(nproc)                   # parallel jobs
export PYASC_DUMP_PATH=$PWD/dumps                  # debug dumps
```

**User context** environment variables (minimal):

```bash
export LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/llvm           # required
# Everything else uses defaults (Release, no devtools, no ccache)
```

**Environment variable reference**:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX` | Yes | - | Path to LLVM installation |
| `PYASC_SETUP_CONFIG` | No | Release | Build config (Debug/Release/RelWithDebInfo) |
| `PYASC_SETUP_DEVTOOLS` | No | 0 | Build dev tools (ascir-opt, ascir-lsp, ascir-translate) |
| `PYASC_SETUP_CCACHE` | No | 0 | Enable ccache for faster rebuilds |
| `PYASC_SETUP_CLANG_LLD` | No | 0 | Use clang/lld instead of gcc |
| `PYASC_SETUP_DOCS` | No | 0 | Generate MLIR documentation |
| `PYASC_SETUP_JOBS` | No | auto | Number of parallel build jobs |
| `PYASC_SETUP_COVERAGE` | No | 0 | Enable code coverage |
| `PYASC_SETUP_ASAN` | No | 0 | Enable AddressSanitizer |
| `PYASC_SETUP_CMAKE_APPEND` | No | - | Additional CMake arguments |
| `PYASC_SETUP_BUILD_DIR` | No | build | Temporary build directory |
| `PYASC_HOME` | No | ~/.pyasc | Cache directory for dependencies |
| `PYASC_DUMP_PATH` | No | - | Directory for debug dumps |

### Phase 3: Check Installed Packages

**Goal**: Verify system and Python dependencies are installed.

#### 3.1 System Dependencies

**Check installed tools**:

```bash
gcc --version
cmake --version
ninja --version
ccache --version  # optional
clang --version   # optional
lld --version     # optional
```

> **Recommendation**: It is recommended to use `clang` and `lld` instead of `gcc` to significantly speed up the build process. Set `PYASC_SETUP_CLANG_LLD=1` to enable them.

**If any required tool is missing**:

Report which tools are missing and ask the user: "The following build tools are missing: {list}. Would you like me to install them? (requires sudo)"

Recommended installation command (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential ccache clang lld
```

#### 3.2 Python Version

Must be 3.9+:

```bash
python3 --version
```

#### 3.3 Virtual Environment

**CRITICAL**: NEVER overwrite an existing virtual environment. Always check for existing venvs first.

**Search for existing venvs in the project root**:

**CRITICAL**: `.venv` (hidden directory with dot prefix) is the MOST COMMON venv name in this project.
You MUST check for hidden directories (starting with `.`) FIRST. Do NOT rely only on glob patterns
like `*venv*` — they do NOT match hidden directories by default in bash.

```bash
# Search for ALL venvs (hidden and non-hidden)
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d \( -name '*venv*' -o -name '*pythonenv*' \) 2>/dev/null
```

If the output is empty, no venv was found.

**Decision logic based on search results**:

- **One venv found** (e.g., `.venv`): Use it automatically without asking.
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```
  Then skip to Section 3.4.

- **Multiple venvs found** (e.g., `.venv`, `venv`, `env`): Ask the user which one to use.
  
  Ask the user: "Multiple virtual environments found in the project root: {list}. Which one should I activate?"
  
  After the user selects, activate it:
  ```bash
  source <selected_venv>/bin/activate
  ```
  Then skip to Section 3.4.

- **No venv found**: Ask the user whether to create one.
  
  Ask the user: "No virtual environment found in the project root. Would you like me to create one?"
  
  **BEFORE creating, verify the directory does not exist**:
  ```bash
  test -d .venv && echo "ERROR: .venv already exists" || python3 -m venv .venv --prompt pyasc
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

#### 3.4 Python Build Dependencies

**Check if installed**:

Read `build-system.requires` from `pyproject.toml` to get the list of build dependencies, then check with `pip list` which ones are missing.

**If missing**:

Ask the user: "Python build dependencies are missing: {list}. Would you like me to install them?"

Installation command (compose from pyproject.toml):
```bash
pip install <package1> <package2> ...
```

#### 3.5 CANN Toolkit Check (CONDITIONAL)

> **Only needed if the user requires simulator or NPU testing. Skip this step for build-only workflows.**

**Check installation**:

```bash
ls /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh || ls ~/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
```

**Activate**:

```bash
source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
```

**For simulator**:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ASCEND_HOME_PATH/tools/simulator/Ascend950PR_9599/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

**If CANN not found**:

Report the error and ask the user: "CANN toolkit is not installed. It is required for simulator/NPU testing. Would you like me to help you install it?"

See @docs/installation/setup-runtime-env.rst for detailed installation instructions.

**Failure handling**:
- System package missing: Report which packages are missing and ask the user whether to install them (requires `sudo`)
- Python version < 3.9: Report error "Python 3.9+ is required. Current version: {version}" and ask user to upgrade
- No venv: Ask user whether to create one (see Section 3.3)
- pip install fails: Report error and recommend checking network connection and pip version
- CANN not found: Report error and ask user whether to install (only if needed for testing)

---

### Phase 4: Build Project

**Goal**: Build and install PyAsc.

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT proceed with build until you have explicitly asked the user which configuration to use and received a clear answer.

Steps depend on context from Phase 2.

#### 4.1 Developer Build (recommended for contributors)

```bash
# Install build deps first
pip install -r requirements-build.txt

# Build with all developer options
export PYASC_SETUP_DEVTOOLS=1
export PYASC_SETUP_CCACHE=1
export PYASC_SETUP_CLANG_LLD=1
export PYASC_SETUP_CONFIG=Debug

# Install in editable mode with verbose output
pip install --no-build-isolation -e . -v
```

#### 4.2 Standard Build (for users)

```bash
pip install .
```

#### 4.3 Editable Install (developer, without devtools on PATH)

```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### 4.4 Build Wheel

```bash
pip wheel . --no-deps -w dist/
```

#### Verification After Build

```bash
# Check package installed
pip list | grep pyasc

# Check Python imports
python -c "import asc, asc2; print('PyAsc imported successfully')"

# Check dev tools (if PYASC_SETUP_DEVTOOLS=1)
which ascir-opt
which ascir-lsp
which ascir-translate
```

**Scope**: This skill is responsible only for environment setup and building PyAsc. Testing, debugging, and error fixing are outside the scope of this skill.

**Failure handling**:
- Build fails: Check LLVM, compiler version, try Debug config
- Import fails: Check `pip list`, verify venv active
- Tools not found: Ensure `PYASC_SETUP_DEVTOOLS=1` was set during build

---

## Agent Constraints

**CRITICAL**: The agent MUST follow these constraints:

- **NEVER** assume build configuration based on context — ALWAYS ask the user explicitly
- **DO NOT** modify source code files
- **DO NOT** install any software (apt packages, pip packages, download archives) without explicitly asking the user first
- **DO NOT** install packages in system Python (always use virtual environment)
- **DO NOT** change system settings without explicit user request
- **ALWAYS** report missing dependencies with clear error messages
- **ALWAYS** ask the user before installing any dependency or downloading any file
- **ALWAYS** check file existence before executing commands
- **ALWAYS** offer alternatives if something is not found
- **ALWAYS** verify installations after each phase
- **NEVER** run `sudo` commands without user confirmation
- **NEVER** delete or overwrite existing configurations without asking
- **NEVER** create a virtual environment if one already exists in the project root
- **ALWAYS** verify venv directory does not exist before running `python3 -m venv`
- **NEVER** report "Virtual environment not found" without first explicitly checking for hidden directories (`.venv`, `pythonenv`) using `find . -maxdepth 1 -type d \( -name '*venv*' -o -name '*pythonenv*' \)`
- **ALWAYS** use `find . -maxdepth 1 -type d \( -name '*venv*' -o -name '*pythonenv*' \) 2>/dev/null` as a standalone command — empty output means no venv found, non-empty output shows found venvs

## Troubleshooting

### LLVM not found

**Symptom**: `LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX is not set` or `MLIRConfig.cmake not found`

**Solution**:
1. Download LLVM from the links in Phase 1
2. Extract to preferred location
3. Set: `export LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/llvm`

### CMake not found

**Symptom**: `cmake: command not found`

**Solution**:

Report the error to the user. CMake and Ninja are installed via pip automatically during `pip install` (or from `requirements-build.txt` when `--no-build-isolation` is used).

If still missing, install build dependencies first:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-build.txt
```

### Build fails with compilation errors

**Symptom**: C++ compilation errors during `pip install`

**Solution**:
1. Check system clang version: `clang --version`
2. Ensure `PYASC_SETUP_CLANG_LLD=1` is set
3. Verify LLVM installation: `$LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin/llvm-config --version`

### CANN toolkit not found

**Symptom**: `ASCEND_HOME_PATH is not set`

**Solution**:

Report the error to the user and ask: "CANN toolkit is not installed. Would you like me to help you install it?"

Recommended steps:
1. Download CANN 9.x or newer from the official Ascend repository
2. Install: `bash Ascend-cann-toolkit_*_linux-$(arch).run --full`
3. Activate: `source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh`

### Simulator not working

**Symptom**: Errors when running tests with `Backend.Model`

**Solution**:
1. Check `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
2. Verify libraries: `ls $ASCEND_HOME_PATH/tools/simulator/Ascend950PR_9599/lib/`
3. Add to environment: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ASCEND_HOME_PATH/tools/simulator/Ascend950PR_9599/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

### Virtual environment issues

**Symptom**: `source .venv/bin/activate` fails

**Solution**:

Ask the user to either delete the broken virtual environment manually or provide the correct path to a working one.

### Permission denied

**Symptom**: `Permission denied` when accessing LLVM or CANN

**Solution**:

> **CRITICAL**: Ask the user before running chmod.

```bash
chmod +x $LLVM_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin/*
chmod +x /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
```
