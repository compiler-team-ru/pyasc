Tools
=====

The following tools are provided to project contributors to enhance their development and debugging capabilities.


MLIR LSP server: ``ascir-lsp``
----------------------------------

The tool implements language server protocol which is used by IDEs to effectively provide syntax highlighting, as well
as other language processing features, both for built-in MLIR dialects and AscendIR extensions.

To enable ``ascir-lsp`` server in Visual Studio Code:

1. Install `MLIR extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-mlir>`__.
2. Obtain full path to the built executable (e.g. run ``which ascir-lsp``).
3. Paste the path to *Mlir: Server_path* setting (``mlir.server_path``).


MLIR optimizer driver: ``ascir-opt``
----------------------------------------

The tool supports all features and command line options that are supported by ``mlir-opt`` (LLVM built-in application),
and is also able to run AscendIR passes with its dialects and extensions.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ascir-opt -ascendc-insert-bufid-sync -canonicalize -mlir-print-ir-before-all test.mlir
