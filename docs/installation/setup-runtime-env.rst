Ascend CANN
-----------

1. Download installation package from `the download center <https://www.hiascend.com/cann/download>`__
   (recommended version is ``9.2.0-beta.1``) **depending on the host platform**:

   .. code:: bash

      wget https://ascend-cann-open.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/CANN/CANN%209.2.0-beta.1/Ascend-cann_9.2.0-beta.1_linux-x86_64.run

2. Install downloaded package with the following command:

   .. code:: bash

      bash Ascend-cann_9.2.0-beta.1_linux-x86_64.run --full

3. Enable CANN environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

       source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh  # or ~/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh in case of user installation
       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ASCEND_HOME_PATH/tools/simulator/Ascend950PR_9599/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

To learn more about CANN environment, visit `the homepage <https://www.hiascend.com/cann>`__.
Ascend C API reference is available in `the documentation <https://www.hiascend.com/document/detail/zh/canncommercial/900/API/ascendcopapi/atlasascendc_api_07_0003.html>`__.

PyTorch
-------

It is recommended to install ``torch`` (CPU-only) to run tutorials and develop PyAsc operators.
The package can be installed via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
