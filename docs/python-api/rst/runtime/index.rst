Attributes from the following classes can be used as keyword arguments in :py:obj:`asctile.jit` decorator.

    The user can mix options from different sections. For example, to disable ``CodegenOptions.capture_exceptions`` and
    set ``CompileOptions.opt_level`` to ``2``, the kernel function may be decorated as the following:

    .. code-block:: python

        @asctile.jit(capture_exceptions=False, opt_level=2)
        def kernel(x, y):
            ...
